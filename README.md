## 📌 About

This repository contains my personal **TryHackMe CTF writeups**, created for learning, practice, and documenting my offensive security journey. Each writeup follows a clear methodology:

* Enumeration
* Initial access
* Shell stabilization
* Privilege escalation
* Flag / objective completion
* ETC ...

The goal is to build strong red team fundamentals while keeping writeups clean, structured, and reproducible.
